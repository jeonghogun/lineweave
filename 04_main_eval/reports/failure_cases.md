# Stage 4 Residual Failure Cases

| # | Document | Category | Description | Referenced Rule | Stage 5 Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | doc_007 | Discourse label tie | Annotators disagreed between `result` and `elaboration` for the fleet exercise follow-up sentence. | Stage 3 `discourse_refinement.md` (result vs. elaboration triggers) | Add lexical cue table distinguishing performance consequences from descriptive add-ons. |
| 2 | doc_014 | Priority conflict | Modal language in Federalist No. 4’s risk analysis competed with causal framing, producing a split between `cause` and `elaboration`. | Stage 3 `scope_modal_tense_resolution.md` | Extend decision tree with mixed deontic-causal branch including worked example. |
| 3 | doc_015 | Counter-current omission | Annotator B dropped the adversative flag tied to “but” when summarizing faction dangers. | Stage 3 `counter_current_checks.md` | Add checklist reminder that adversative markers inside compound sentences must retain counter-current flags unless explicitly neutralized. |
| 4 | doc_018 | Evidence granularity | Both annotators agreed on relations but requested finer evidence snippets; current 60-character truncation hides clause breaks. | Stage 1 template (`discourse_links.evidence`) | Increase evidence guidance to include explicit clause quoting and cite scope ring IDs for traceability. |
| 5 | doc_021 | Question typing | Dialogue opener interpreted as `question` by Annotator B and `result` by Annotator A when the statement framed news. | Stage 3 `discourse_refinement.md` (question vs. transition) | Provide dialogue-specific primer clarifying when statements phrased as questions are still context-setting transitions. |
| 6 | doc_022 | Emotion cloud tone | Stage 3 lexicon limited to eight tones; annotators debated between `concern` and `calm` for neutral household responses. | Stage 3 `emotion_cloud_lexicon.md` | Introduce decision cues for defaulting to `calm` when hedging verbs appear without negative valence. |
| 7 | doc_023 | Scope span clipping | Sentence-level ring excluded closing quotation mark, causing schema validator warnings during manual review (resolved). | Stage 1 `scope_priority.md` | Document punctuation-inclusive spans in Stage 5 with explicit examples. |
| 8 | doc_024 | Counter-current strength | Annotator B suppressed counter-current markers citing redundancy; adjudication restored them but noted lack of severity scale. | Stage 3 `counter_current_checks.md` | Add severity tiering (soft vs. strong opposition) so annotators keep the flag while indicating strength. |
| 9 | doc_025 | Discourse chain depth | Dialogue contained three turns but template supports only pairwise edges, limiting multi-turn capture. | Stage 1 `discourse_inventory.md` | Draft Stage 5 extension allowing chained dialogue links with ordered IDs. |
| 10 | doc_026 | Ribbon neutrality | Automatic ribbon value `0` for dialogue downplays persuasive swings noted in text. | Stage 0 `metrics.md` (Ribbon axis guidance) | Clarify ribbon scaling for dialogue (e.g., neutral = 0, persuasion = ±1) with examples. |
| 11 | doc_028 | Relation blending | Annotator B tagged supportive assertion as `elaboration` while Annotator A preferred `cause` due to “because” clause. | Stage 3 `discourse_refinement.md` | Add example pair showing “because” dominance unless sentence lacks causal predicate. |
| 12 | doc_030 | Template field fatigue | Annotators requested automation for `surface_rail_notes`, leading to terse entries. | Stage 1 `annotation_template.jsonl` guidance | Build Stage 5 macro that imports rail notes from Stage 3 quickref and prompts for deviation summary. |
